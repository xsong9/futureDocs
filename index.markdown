# Front page
Your content goes here!
Here's another sentence. 
Line breaks! They aren't automatic.

You need a blank line to make a second paragraph. 
* for bulleted lists you just use an asterisk
* same bulleted list!

1. wow you can make a numbered list just like this! ezpz.
2. markdown is smart.
2. if i make a bulleted list and add the same number twice
2. it numerates correctly anyway

`you can use a backtick for a single line of code`

```
you can use three backticks for multiline codeblocks
you just need to enter after the backticks
bundle install jekyll
bundle exec serve
```
