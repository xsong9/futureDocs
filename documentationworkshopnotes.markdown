    * Open the folder in vsc
    * Edit readme in vsc and save it
    * See the change in Github Desktop
    * Push the change in Github Desktop
    * Check site locally

* Create a document
    * Clarity
        * Text should be skimmable.
        * Use short sentences for easy read.
        * Users should be able to follow your documentation without closely reading every word.
        * No negative or double negative gotchas.
    * Parallelism
        * Sentences should be formatted uniformly.
        * Words should appear in the same order in sentences within a section.
        * You may think repetition will lull users into skipping instructions but it’s easier for users that are reading along as they perform the instructions.
